                                Lorem Ipsum is a dummy text that is mainly used by the printing and design industry.
                                It is intended to show how the type will look before the end product is available.
                                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500:s, when
                                an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                                book. Lorem Ipsum dummy texts was available for many years on adhesive sheets in
                                different sizes and typefaces from a company called Letraset. When computers came
                                along, Aldus included lorem ipsum in its PageMaker publishing software, and you
                                now see it wherever designers, content designers, art directors, user interface
                                developers and web designer are at work. They use it daily when using programs such
                                as Adobe Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, Dreamweaver, FrontPage, PageMaker, FrameMaker,
                                Illustrator, Flash, Indesign etc.</p>
